Hey there.

After a few attempts with the coderade [.in](http://coderade.in) and [.io](http://coderade.io) blogs, I have returned to blogging again.

But now, after using the [coderade.github.io](https://coderade.github.io), I bought the [valde.ci](https://valde.ci) domain, which is quite expensive hehe, and I have the freedom for customization without excuses.

I'm hosting this blog on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is free and very easy to use.

On this blog, I will write mostly about coding, DevOps, and Software Engineering (some IT stuff), but I'll also try to share my experiences in this vast life too (yeah, at 28 years old).

This blog is powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and I normally use [**Visual Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write my posts with Markdown :heart:.

## About Me

I am a Sr. Cloud Architect / Sr. Software Engineer from Brazil, 28 years old, born and raised in [**Guaratuba - Brazil**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaratuba), but I have lived in many cities since I learned how to buy bus and flight tickets.

I have more than 8 years of experience working in the IT area. I've worked as an IT infrastructure analyst, web developer, software engineer, and DevOps and IoT engineer. Most of the time, I've worked with Linux and coding, and I love it.

Currently, I'm working as a Sr. Cloud Application Architect at Amazon Web Services ([**AWS**](https://aws.amazon.com/)).

I like to study every day, so I have some course certificates available [**here**](https://github.com/coderade/certificates#certificates). I also enjoy learning new languages whenever possible (currently, I speak Portuguese, English, and a little Spanish, and I'm eager to learn a new language).

I like sports, so I go to the gym every day (*after I finish this update, I'll do some workout*). I also enjoy running, cycling, surfing, playing drums, meditating, reading, and studying math, trying to maintain a healthy and good routine.

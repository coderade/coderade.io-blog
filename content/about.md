Hi there.

After a few attempts with the coderade [.in](http://coderade.in) and
[.io](http://coderade.io) blogs, I returned to write in a blog again.

But now with no expensive domain and freedom in customization excuses, heheh.
I'm hosting this blog on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that is
totally free and is very easy to use.

On this blog I will write about coding, DevOps and Software Engineering, life hacks and I'll try to share my
experiences in this vast life (yeah, with 24 years old).

The blog is powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and I normally use the ~~IDEA~~
[Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) to write my posts with Markdown :heart:.

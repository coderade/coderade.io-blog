Since I started to code in 2012, I learned to love the open source life, I learned to love how the community is open to 
share and help other people, sharing the coding who they worked hard and making it possible to run in a couple of 
minutes for anybody in the world, sharing your knowledge with questions and answers on the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
and all of the [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) sites, creating docs and tutorials in blogs and sites like [Medium](https://medium.com/) 
and [GitHub](https://github.com/).
 
I learned to love how all of this made my learning curve so much easier in the Software Engineering area. 

Being honest, I really don't think that I would be happy how I am now working as a Software Engineer without the Open Source 
and the Open Source community. 

So in this article I will try to share a little of my life using Open Source.

## Why work with Open Source is important today?

Today all the biggest companies in the world understand how Open source is important for the evolution of their business and the 
technology in general, focusing in create their own open sources projects. Great examples are the [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)
from Microsoft, [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) from Apple and [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) 
from Facebook.

And I am really happy with this, because [IMHO](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IMHO) 
I think I am doing great focusing in the Open Source as a Software Engineer and person. If you think in improve your career
I can share with you the number of opportunities that I receive daily from Brazil (the current country that I am living on) 
and Abroad -> on my LinkedIn, StackOverflow and Github profiles.

## My life using Open Source

Today, everything I do in a normal day is using open source. I use the [manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) system as my personal 
and work OS.
I work with technologies like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), 
[Docker](https://github.com/docker) and so on. I use the all possible examples from people of the community on the GitHub, 
besides the help and the code that I normally get on the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

In this way, today also, whenever possible I get really happy when I share some code that I am studying on [my GitHub](https://github.com/coderade), 
when I write some posts on this [blog](/) and when I ask or answer some questions on the StackOverflow and StackExchange sites. 

I had slightly decreased the frequency of contributions in the recent times because I was trying to organize my next career
goals and I saw that one best things that I can do is always contribute to the community in all possible ways. And I now 
I am trying to back in full force with these contributions ðŸš€. 

### Some of my Open Source work:

- [**My Resume**](https://github.com/coderade/my-latex-resume) - my resume is developed using the Latex/TeX technologies 
based on the amazing project [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) which I just gave a little custom in my

*Currently I have 72 public repositories on [**my GitHub**](https://github.com/coderade) showing a little of what I am
studying. I always try to document my projects, making easy to everyone run them and I normally follow the main standards 
of code, quality, testability and safety, Please take a look!

In this article I tried to show with IMHO how the Open Source and the Open Source community changed my work and personal 
life and how I think that the Open Source ideas can make any person a little better giving some examples of what I am 
doing in the Open Source community. 

If You like this article or think that I can improve something, please try to give a comment. This is how the Open Source works! ðŸ‘Š

You also can try to read the others articles on this blog when you have some time. 

Thanks for reading.

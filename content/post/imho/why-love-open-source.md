Since I started coding in 2012, I learned to love the open-source life and how the community is open to sharing and helping others. People share the code they worked hard on, making it possible for anyone in the world to run it in a couple of minutes. They also share their knowledge with questions and answers on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and all of the [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) sites, creating docs and tutorials on blogs and sites like [Medium](https://medium.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

I learned to love how all of this made my learning curve so much less complicated in the Software Engineering area.

Honestly, I don't think I would be as happy as I am now working as a Software Engineer without Open Source and the Open Source community.

So in this article, I will try to share a little of my life using Open Source.

## Why is working with Open Source so important today?

Today, all the biggest companies in the world understand how indispensable Open Source is for the evolution of their business and technology in general, focusing on creating their open-source projects. Great examples are [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) from Microsoft, [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) from Apple, and [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) from Facebook.

I am content with this because [IMHO](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IMHO) I think I am doing great by focusing on Open Source as a Software Engineer and person. If you want to improve your career, I can share with you the number of opportunities that I receive daily from Brazil (the country I currently live in) and abroad through my LinkedIn, StackOverflow, and GitHub profiles.

## My life using Open Source

Today, everything I do daily involves using open-source. I use the [manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) system as my personal and work OS. I work with technologies like [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Docker](https://github.com/docker). I use all possible examples from the community on GitHub, besides the help and code I usually get on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Whenever possible, I am happy to share some code that I am studying on [my GitHub](https://github.com/coderade), write posts on this [blog](/), and ask or answer questions on StackOverflow and StackExchange sites.

Recently, I had slightly decreased my contributions because I was organizing my next career goals. However, I realized that one of the best things I can do is always contribute to the community in all possible ways. Now, I am trying to come back in full force with these contributions ðŸš€.

### Some of my Open Source work:

- [**My Resume**](https://github.com/coderade/my-latex-resume) - My rÃ©sumÃ© is developed using Latex/TeX technologies based on the project [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), which I customized a little. Today, the source code of my rÃ©sumÃ© is available on the [my-latex-resume](https://github.com/coderade/my-latex-resume) project on my GitHub.
- [**This blog**](/) - This blog is developed using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), one of the best Static Site Generation (SSG) tools today, and which I love. Everything here is open-source. The structure and posts of this blog are available on the [coderade.io-blog](https://github.com/coderade/coderade.io-blog) project, and the generated code is available on the [coderade.github.io](https://github.com/coderade/coderade.github.io) project. The theme is available on the [coderade-minimalist-theme](https://github.com/coderade/coderade-minimalist-theme).
- [**My StackOverflow profile**](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4157589/coderade?tab=profile) - I use it every day, and I like to ask and answer questions on StackOverflow whenever possible. The StackExchange platform is not open-source, but it's a great platform to get help and try to help the community.
- [**Some big projects that I was able to contribute to**](https://github.com/coderade):
  - [**pySkypeBotApi**](https://github.com/coderade/pySkypeBotApi) - A simple Skype bot wrapper using Python and Flask for the Bot Connector/Rest service.
  - [**awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples**](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples) - I helped with some code examples used in the official AWS SDK documentation.
  - [**jiaaro/pydub**](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) - I helped with the documentation of the [Pydub](http://pydub.com/) project.
  - [**sergi/jsftp**](https://github.com/sergi/jsftp) - A client FTP library for NodeJS that focuses on correctness, clarity, and conciseness.
  - [**demo-progressive-web-app**](https://demopwa.surge.sh/)/[gokulkrishh/demo-progressive-web-app](https://github.com/gokulkrishh/demo-progressive-web-app) - A demo for a progressive web application with features like offline, push notifications, background sync, etc.
  - [**Atyantik/react-pwa**](https://github.com/Atyantik/react-pwa) - An upgradable boilerplate for progressive web applications (PWA) with server-side rendering, built with SEO in mind, and achieving max page speed and optimized user experience.
  
>>> **There are some other examples of projects which I had the pleasure to contribute to available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/coderade).

- Some of my studies in various technologies and topics:
  - My studies with Ruby, Rails, and TDD:
    - [**tdd-rails-examples**](https://github.com/coderade/tdd-rails-examples) - Some examples of how to use TDD in Ruby on Rails.
    - [**react-twitter-clone**](https://github.com/coderade/react-twitter-clone) - A Twitter clone created with Rails 5 and React.
  - My studies with React and React Native:
    - [**reactNativeCoursesApp**](https://github.com/coderade/reactNativeCoursesApp) - A courses app built using React Native and Materialize based on my Lynda React Courses project.
    - [**react-redux-es6**](https://github.com/coderade/react-redux-es6) - A project to study React, Redux, and ES6 more deeply.
  - [**My studies with Ansible**](https://github.com/coderade/ansible-examples) - A project with some examples of how to use Ansible.
  
Today, I have 72 public repositories on [**my GitHub**](https://github.com/coderade) showcasing what I am studying. I always try to document my projects, making it easy for everyone to run them. I try to follow the leading code standards, quality, testability, and safety whenever possible. Please take a look!

In this article, I tried to show with IMHO how Open Source and the Open Source community changed my work and personal life and how I think that the Open Source ideas can make anyone a little better, giving some examples of what I am doing in the Open Source community.

If you like this article or think that I can improve something, please comment. That is how Open Source works! ðŸ‘Š

You can also read the other articles on this blog when you have some time.

Thanks for reading.

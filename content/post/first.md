Hi there.

After a few attempts with the coderade [.in](http://coderade.in) and [.io](http://coderade.io) blogs, 
I started to write in a blog again and now with no expensive domain and freedom in customization 
excuses, heheh.

On this blog I will write about code, life hacks and I'll try to share my experiences in this vast life (yeah, with 23 years old).

The blog is powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and I normally use the [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to write 
my posts with Markdown ❤️.


## About me

Arch Linux user (Using Manjaro now ;)) and Java Certificated Developer, I have four years of experience with Web and Mobile 
development and I really loves what I do, especially when done in the right way.

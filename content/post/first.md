Hi there.

After a few attempts with the coderade [.in](http://coderade.in) and
[.io](http://coderade.io) blogs, I returned to write in a blog again.

But now with no expensive domain and freedom in customization excuses, heheh.
I'm hosting this blog on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that is
totally free and is very easy to use.

On this blog I will write about code, life hacks and I'll try to share my
experiences in this vast life (yeah, with 23 years old).

The blog is powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and I normally use the ~~IDEA~~
[Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) to write my posts with Markdown :heart:.


## About me

I am a Software Developer from Curitiba - BR focused on open-source technologies,
with a very special love for JS, Android and Ruby on Rails.

Arch Linux user (Using [manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) now :wink:) and Java Certified
Developer, I have five years of experience with Web and Mobile development and
I really loves what I do, especially when done in the right way.

I born and raised on the seacoast of my state, so since I was a child I love
the most sports and try to practice as much of them as possible.

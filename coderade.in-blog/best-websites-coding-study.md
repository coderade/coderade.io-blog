Best websites to study coding - https://web.archive.org/web/20160329062839/http://coderade.in/best-websites-to-study-coding/
For those who are starting their studies in the programming world or for those already studying some time, a question that often comes up is: How and where should I study?

Many prefer learning with the use of printed books, but we know that most of them are not accessible to most people, at least here in Brazil (and we have e-books and .pdf files, lol), making the study on the Internet the best option to have a great cost-benefit.

But one question that remains for those who are starting  is how to start them, so  How to study coding on the Internet?

After some time studying at foreign sites (I’m brazilian) I was able to evaluate and select the best sites for courses in my opinion, sites that I use today, namely:

Pluralsight – one of the companies in the education sector with fastest growing in the recent years. The Pluralsight in my opinion is one of the best, if not the best site for studies of various technologies, and the site that I’m  using today – the Pluralsight owned courses in English (with the possibility of subtitles in other languages) and plans are among $ 29 and $ 49 (USD) per month.
Lynda  one of the oldest and largest companies in this sector, currently acquired by LinkedIn, and in my opinion one of the best and fully comparable with Pluralsight  –  Like the Pluralsight the Lynda also has courses in English (with the possibility of subtitles in other languages) and their plans are between $ 24.99 and $ 34.99 (USD) per month.
Video2Brain – initially a Spanish version of Lynda (now owned versions in German and French) great for people who have expertise in these languages – it has monthly plans with values from $ 9 (USD).
Safari Books Online -Awesome digital library with several courses, books and etc.  created from the joint venture between two leading brands in this sector O’Reilly Media e a Pearson IT. Great option for people as well as video lessons like to have a vast library of books your hand – they have monthly plans with values from $ 39 (USD).
TreeHouse – site with awesome courses in the English language, ideal for people who prefer a more fun and outgoing teaching, in which for example you can earn badges as their evolution in the courses – it has plans of $ 25 and $ 49 per month.
CodeSchool – excellent site for people with more extensive studies focus, which they can follow learning tracks of the desired technology. Its teaching is very similar to the TreeHouse. Recently the CodeSchool was acquired by Pluralsight – The CodeSchool has free and paid plans of $ 29 (dollars per month).
The only problem of the sites mentioned above is that they are paid and paid in US dollars, something that today is not very nice for the Brazilians. But compared to some Brazilian sites they end up being cheaper.

There are also excellent options for free courses in which I already could test the MITOpen, Khan Academy, Codeacademy and Coursera.

These are the tips that I made in my short time experience if you want to give tips on new courses or found errors have no problem in discussing them. Thank you very much!
